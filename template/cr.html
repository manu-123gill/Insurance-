<p>Car insurance is a contract between a car owner and a general insurance company 
wherein the latter promises to protect the car owner from financial losses which may 
occur due to an unfortunate event involving his/her car. Depending on the scope of coverage, 
there are 3 types of car insurance policies - Third-Party Car Insurance, Standalone Own-Damage 
(OD) Car Insurance, and Comprehensive Car Insurance. To continue to avail the benefits of these policies, the car insurance renewal should be processed on time by policyholders.</p></div>

<h3>Own Damage Car Insurance</h3>
<p>In September 2019, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) introduced the standalone Own-Damage car insurance policy. Under this plan, the insured gets insurance coverage only for the own-damages sustained by his/her four-wheeler in a road accident, natural/man-made calamity, fire, explosion, theft or any other mishap. A standalone own-damage car insurance policy aims at offering the insured the flexibility in terms of the insurance provider they want to choose.</p>
